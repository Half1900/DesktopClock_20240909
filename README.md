A configurable digital clock app for your Windows desktop that remains visible on screen so it's there whenever you need it.

With a right-click, access essential options like size, time zone, format, and theme, or make new clocks from the same menu.
Double left-click will copy the time to the clipboard, and holding Ctrl while scrolling will resize the clock.
For power users, "advanced settings" provides even more configuration choices in a familiar JSON format.
There's also a countdown mode that allows you to set a countdown to any date of your choice.
